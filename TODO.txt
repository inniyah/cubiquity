LOD for smooth terrain

Clever material handling for smooth terrain. Only pass most important materials? Pack more than one material intensity into a single float? Sort material intensities so that we can just process the first x materials in fragment shader?

Consider editing with higher precision than we store at? Maybe copy the part of the volume that's being edited into a temporary buffer and edit that?
