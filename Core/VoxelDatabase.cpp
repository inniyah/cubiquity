	// This function encodes a Region as a 64-bit integer so that it can be used as a key to access block data in the SQLite database.
	// A region actually contains more than 64-bits of data so some has to be lost here. Specifically we assume that we already know
	// the size of the region (so we only have to encode it's lower corner and not its upper corner or extents), and we also restrict
	// the range of valid coordinates. A Region's coordinates are represented by 3-bits of data, but we only support converting to a key 
	// if every coordinate can be represented by 21 bits of data. This way we can fit three coordinates only 63 bits of data. This limits
	// the range of values to +/- 2^20, which is enough for our purposes.
